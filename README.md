# Meta_React_Native_Working_With_Data_Final
This showcases my final project from the [Working With Data course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/meta-working-with-data?specialization=meta-react-native). In this project I worked with data in `react-native`, I fetched from an `API` and used an `embedded database`, `SQLite`, as a sort of 'in-house' database for `CRUD` operations.

## The Objective
This is a menu for Little Lemon with the objective of:

- Create a react-native mobile application for the Little Lemon menu.
- Call the API to fetch menu items.
- Initialize the database by creating the db and table.
- Store the menu items and other CRUD operations in SQLite.
- Filter the items by category with SQLite.
- Display the menu items in a SectionList.
